My website (re)written in React & Sass. Pretty barebone. Might add some stuff in the future/bring back features in the legacy site.

_Why?_ I was bored.

### TODO

- [ ] Add tabs & multiple pages

## Preview

## Building

Run `npm i` to install all dependencies if you intend to clone (and/or) modify this.

## Licensing

Repository is licensed under GPL-3.0. Third party dependencies & modules are used under their respective licenses.

_tl;dr_: Feel free to use/modify/redistribute this project to your liking, but you have to keep it **free & open source** (under GPL-3.0 or other compatible licenses), as it is my intention to keep it that way ðŸ’•

Give this project a star if you liked it, credit this repository if you want others to also use this shabby project of mine, and yeah, have fun messing around.

## Archive
