My website (re)written in React & Sass. Pretty barebone.

_Why?_ I was bored.

### TODO

- [x] Add tabs & multiple pages
- [x] Fetch recently played songs from Spotify/Last.fm

## Preview

_(This is pretty outdated lol)_

## Building

Run `npm i` to install all dependencies if you intend to clone (and/or) modify this.

### Core components

Below are the list of components/modules that needs further attention if you decide to modify & use your own instances of it:

- [use-last-fm](https://github.com/alii/use-last-fm)
- [lanyard](https://github.com/Phineas/lanyard)
- [react-clock](https://github.com/wojtekmaj/react-clock) and the `Clock.tsx` file
